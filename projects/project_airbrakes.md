## Project Description

During the 2025-2026 [IREC](https://www.soundingrocket.org/what-is-irec.html) Competition I worked on the system analysis and mechanical design for the [Cornell Rocketry Team's]("{{"site:crt"}}")

Flight scoring is based on the demonstrated altitude achieved relative to target apogee and successful recovery. 

The accuracy of the launch vehicle's actual apogee is worth 70% of the point value of flight performance, and so trajectory planning is important. One strategy in reducing the error between target apogee and flown apogee is the implementation of an Airbrake system. 

The goal of the Airbrake is to lower apogee by removing kinetic energy via drag inducing elements. The deployment occurs in the coast phase of the flight. Airbrakes are an active control system whose outputs are the acutation drag inducing elements and inputs are trajectory (accelerometer, IMU) data.
