        Hello! My name is Langston Johnson. I'm a junior studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. Here I'm an undergraduate researcher at the Space System Design Studio, Structural Engineer on the Cornell Rocketry Team, and Squad Captain for the Cornell Fencing Club. My technical interests are Spacecraft System Design and Architecture. I love staying up to date with the advancements in long term space operations and habitation in Low Earth Orbit, Cislunar Space, and on the Lunar Surface. I believe that the emerging Space Commercial Sector represents the opportunity to develop as a professional engineer in a field I find beautiful, challenging, and inspiring!
